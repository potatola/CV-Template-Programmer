\begin{rSection}{Projects}

\begin{rSubsection}{Game Manager Tool for a MMORPG}{2015.8-2015.9}{NetEase Games}{Hang Zhou}
\item Implemented the main application framework of a game manager tool in two weeks with Python and Mongodb.
\item Reduced time for game designers and QA testers to test the game by 50\% by converting GM functions to be used for testing process.
\item Learned PyQt and Cocos GUI programming, to make game management available both with independent client and embedded interface.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Quality Improvement of Real-time Video Streaming}{2014.3-Present}{Peking University}{Bei Jing}
\item Improved the performance of a UEP scheme for video streaming by formulating the redundancy allocation into a distortion minimization problem and deriving a suboptimal resolution with hill-climbing method.
%\item Implemented a Matlab demo system which simulates our proposed UEP approach, video codec (with JM18) and network transmission with bandwidth limitation and packet loss.
\item Designed a novel delay based congestion control algorithm, and employed a closed-loop control-theoretic model for advanced analysis and performance improvement.
\item Implemented our algorithms with C++ as an independent module embedded in Linphone (an open-source VOIP software), which improved its performance with 3dB or more gain in PSNR, and better performance on bandwidth utilization and flow stability.
\end{rSubsection}

%\begin{rSubsection}{Unequal Error Protection for Video Streaming}{2014.10¡ª2015.2}{Peking University}{Bei Jing}
%%\item Established the mathematics model of an Expanding Window based FEC redundancy allocation approach. Transformed it as an optimization problem and resolved it with a suboptimal hill-climbing scheme.
%\item Improved the performance of a UEP scheme for video streaming by formulating the redundancy allocation into a distortion minimization problem and deriving a suboptimal resolution with hill-climbing method.
%\item Implemented a Matlab demo system which simulates our proposed UEP approach, video codec (with JM18) and network transmission with bandwidth limitation and packet loss.
%\item Extensive experiments were carried out comparing with mainstream approaches, which proves that our method achieved 5dB or more gain in PSNR.
%\item \emph{Paper}: Yufeng Geng, Xinggong Zhang, Chao Zhou, Zongming Guo, Unequal Error Protection For Real-time Video Streaming Using Expanding Window Reed-Solomon Code, Accepted by ICIP 2015.
%\item \emph{Patent}: Redundancy allocation scheme for Reed-Solomon coding in real-time video streaming, 201510170234.5.
